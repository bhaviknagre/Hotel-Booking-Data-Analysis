# Project Title
Hotel Booking Data Analysis using EDA

# Overview
This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of hotel bookings. It aims to identify key patterns in customer behavior, factors influencing cancellations, and insights that can be used to optimize hotel management strategies. By examining booking trends, customer demographics, and booking channels, this analysis provides actionable insights to enhance both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
